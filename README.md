   According the linear regression analysis in R, the strongest contributor of non-random variance seems to be teh vehicle weight with a P-value of 2.60e-12. Another strong contributor is ground clearance with a P-value of 5.21e-08. 

   The slope of this particular linear model is not zero. The slope coefficients contain significant non zero values for each variable, with p-values for vehicle length and ground clearance less than the significance level of p=0.05. 

   The r-squared value calculated for this linear model is 0.7149, meaning this model has good predictive power for the prediction on mpg of current and future vehicles.
